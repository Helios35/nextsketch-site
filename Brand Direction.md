## **Brand Direction**

**Company Name (Current):**  
 **Next Sketch LLC**

**Brand Status:**

* Retaining **Next Sketch** for now

* Rebrand is *directional*, not a hard rename yet

**Brand Positioning Direction:**  
 Next Sketch is evolving from a design-led consultancy into a **strategy-first, AI-driven product and systems partner**.  
 The name remains while the *meaning* of the brand shifts.

**Offering Architecture:**

* **Unified parent brand:** Next Sketch

* **Sub-offerings (intentional):**

  1. **AI-First Product Development**

  2. **AI Workflow & Process Integration**

**Why sub-offerings are recommended (direct answer):**

* You have **two distinct buyer mindsets** (Founder vs. Ops leader)

* A single undifferentiated message would blur value

* Sub-offerings allow:

  * Clear entry points

  * Shared credibility

  * Future productization without rebrand churn

This avoids fragmenting the brand while preserving clarity.
