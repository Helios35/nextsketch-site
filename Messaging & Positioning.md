## **Messaging & Positioning**

### **Core Positioning Statement**

Next Sketch helps founders **decide what to build, why it matters, and who it’s for — then build and validate it quickly using AI-first workflows.**

We also help companies integrate AI into internal operations to reduce friction, lower costs, and improve decision flow.

---

### **Primary Buyer**

* **Founder / CEO**

### **Explicitly Not For**

* Small teams with vague ideas

* Cost-focused buyers

* AI-curious teams without mandate or urgency

(This is intentional and should be stated implicitly across the site.)

---

### **Core Offerings (Homepage Hierarchy)**

#### **1\. AI-First Product Development (Primary)**

Focus:

* SaaS products

* Internal and external tools

* Platforms and integrated UIs

* Monetization-aware product foundations

Positioning:

* Strategy first, but fast

* Decisions before code

* Validation before scale

* Product evolution driven by evidence

#### **2\. AI Workflow & Process Integration (Secondary / Expansion)**

Focus:

* Internal operational tools

* Workflow automation

* Friction reduction across teams

* Cost reduction through intelligent systems

Positioning:

* Extension of product thinking inward

* Same discipline, different surface area

* Systems that support how teams actually work

---

### **Hardware Positioning (Confirmed Constraint)**

* Hardware work is **UI \+ digital interface only**

* No mechanical, industrial, or physical engineering positioning

* Hardware appears only as an endpoint of validated digital systems

---

### **Strategy Framing (Explicit)**

* Strategy is **fast**

* No long discovery

* No open-ended exploration

* Planning sets constraints

* Execution follows immediately

This language should appear clearly, not subtly.

---

### **Business Model (High-Level, Non-Marketing)**

* Retainer-based engagements

* Supports:

  * Product development (build \+ evolve)

  * Ongoing AI workflow / system support (monthly)

This does **not** need to be explained in detail on the site—only implied through seriousness and structure.
