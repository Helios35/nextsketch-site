## 1. Project Identity: WHY This Project Exists

### The Problem We're Solving
Founders need **clarity and speed** in product decisions, but traditional consultancies offer:
- Lengthy discovery phases
- Exploratory workshops without clear outcomes
- Design-led processes that delay execution
- Separation between strategy and implementation

### The Market Gap
No one is positioning strategy as **fast** while maintaining rigor. Agencies either:
- Offer "full-service" everything (no focus)
- Provide "innovative exploration" (no urgency)
- Deliver execution without strategy (no foundation)

### Why This Rebrand Matters
Next Sketch has evolved from **design consultancy** to **strategy-first AI partner**, but the market doesn't know it yet. This rebrand makes that evolution visible and positions us for the buyers we actually want to serve.

### The Transformation
**From:** Design-led consultancy that explores possibilities  
**To:** Strategy-first partner that accelerates decisions  
**How:** AI-first workflows, fast strategy, evidence-driven execution

---

## 2. Core Mental Model: WHAT We Believe

### Fundamental Principles

**1. Strategy Is Fast (Not Exploratory)**
- Planning sets constraints, execution follows immediately
- No long discovery, no endless workshops
- Decisions happen in days, not months
- Speed without sacrificing rigor

**2. Decisions Before Code (Not Iteration Before Clarity)**
- Know what to build before building it
- Validate assumptions before scaling
- Evidence drives evolution, not hope

**3. AI-First Workflows (Not Traditional Methods)**
- Modern tools for modern problems
- Automation where it adds value
- Intelligence applied to operations, not just products

**4. Two Distinct Buyer Mindsets (Not One-Size-Fits-All)**
- **Founders:** Need product clarity and execution speed
- **Ops Leaders:** Need workflow efficiency and cost reduction
- Different entry points, shared methodology

**5. Qualification Over Volume (Not Lead Generation)**
- We're expensive and serious
- Wrong buyers should self-exclude
- Right buyers should feel "this is exactly what I need"

### What We Explicitly Reject

**Rejected Approaches:**
- Long discovery phases
- Exploratory strategy
- Design-first thinking
- Portfolio-led positioning
- Testimonial-based credibility
- Free audits and lead magnets
- "Let's chat" casualness

**Rejected Buyers:**
- Small teams with vague ideas
- Cost-focused buyers
- AI-curious without urgency or mandate
- Anyone wanting "innovation exploration"

---

## 3. Offering Architecture: WHAT We Provide

### Parent Brand: Next Sketch
**Status:** Retaining name while shifting meaning  
**Positioning:** Strategy-first, AI-driven product and systems partner  
**Model:** Retainer-based engagements (implied, not marketed)

### Core Positioning Statement
"Next Sketch helps founders decide what to build, why it matters, and who it's for—then build and validate it quickly using AI-first workflows."

---

### Sub-Offering 1: AI-First Product Development (PRIMARY)

**What It Is:**
The core offering for founders who need to make product decisions and execute quickly.

**What We Build:**
- SaaS products

---

### Hardware Constraint (WHAT WE DON'T DO)

**Explicitly Limited to:**
- UI and digital interfaces for hardware products
- Software that controls or monitors hardware
- Apps that connect to hardware endpoints

**Explicitly Excluded:**
- Mechanical engineering
- Industrial design
- Physical prototyping
- Manufacturing consultation

**Positioning:** Hardware is an endpoint of digital systems, not our core competency.

---

## 4. Target Buyer: WHO This Is For

### Primary Persona: The Decisive Founder

**Title:** Founder / CEO  
**Company Stage:** Seed to Series A (product-stage companies)  
**Budget Reality:** Can afford retainer engagements ($15k-50k+/month implied)

**Psychographic Profile:**
- Values clarity over exploration
- Needs speed without sacrificing quality
- Has mandate and urgency (not just curiosity)
- Willing to make decisions with imperfect information
- Understands the value of strategy
- Frustrated with slow traditional processes

**Pain Points:**
1. **Analysis Paralysis:** Too many options, not enough direction
2. **Slow Discovery:** Traditional agencies take months to start
3. **Unclear Fit:** Don't know if product-market fit exists
4. **Implementation Gap:** Strategy decks that never become products
5. **AI Confusion:** Knows AI matters, unclear how to apply it

**Buying Triggers:**
- Product vision exists but execution path is unclear
- Timeline pressure (market window, funding runway, competition)
- Previous agency/consultant disappointment
- Internal team lacks strategic clarity or AI expertise

**Success Signals:**
- Asks about methodology and timeline in first call
- Mentions budget/engagement model proactively
- References specific product decisions that need to be made
- Shows frustration with "let's explore" approaches

---

### Explicitly NOT For

**Wrong Buyers (Implicitly Excluded via Positioning):**

1. **Vague Idea Stage:**
   - "We have this concept..." (not a product)
   - "We're thinking about..." (not committed)
   - "We want to explore..." (not ready)

2. **Cost-Focused:**
   - "What's your hourly rate?" (wrong question)
   - "Can we do a small pilot?" (not how we work)
   - "We have a limited budget..." (not aligned)

3. **AI Tourism:**
   - "We're curious about AI..." (not urgent)
   - "We want to experiment..." (not serious)
   - "Everyone's doing AI..." (no strategy)

4. **Committee Buyers:**
   - Need extensive stakeholder buy-in (slow)
   - Require multiple approval layers (friction)
   - Looking for "safe" vendor (not us)

**How We Exclude Them:**
- Serious tone (not friendly/approachable agency)
- Implied retainer model (not project-based)
- "Conversation qualifier" not "free consultation"
- Focus on speed and decisions (not exploration)

---

## 5. Design Philosophy: HOW It Should Feel

### Design Principles (High-Level)

**1. Professional Credibility Without Corporate Stiffness**
- Serious engagement model, not startup-casual
- Founder-to-founder peer relationship
- Technical credibility without jargon overload

**2. Modern and AI-Forward**
- Xtract-level polish (https://xtract.framer.ai/)
- Interactive elements that demonstrate capability
- Process visualization, not just description
- Clean, technical aesthetic

**3. Decision-Oriented Visual Language**
- Clear hierarchy (primary vs secondary offerings)
- Bold statements, not hedged language
- Speed communicated visually and verbally
- Action-oriented design (not exploratory)

**4. Generous Whitespace = Confidence**
- Premium feel through restraint
- Focus on key messages, not clutter
- Room for ideas to breathe
- Professional maturity

**5. Interactive Demonstration**
- Show methodology in action
- Process timelines visible
- Capability hints, not portfolio
- Scroll-triggered reveals

---

### Visual Inspiration: Xtract Template

**What to Borrow:**
- Clean sectional scrolling
- Interactive UI elements (task lists, workflows, code snippets)
- Process visualization with timelines
- Horizontal scrolling for benefits/case studies
- Modern AI automation aesthetic
- Professional without being corporate

**What to Adapt:**
- Color palette (Xtract uses bright blues/purples, we need Next Sketch identity)
- Case studies → Benefits carousel (no portfolio)
- Testimonials → Value props (no social proof)
- Service cards → Offering differentiation

**What to Avoid:**
- Templated feel (should be distinctly Next Sketch)
- Over-animation (performance matters)
- Generic stock imagery (if any images used)
- Agency portfolio patterns (explicitly rejected)

---

## 6. Messaging Framework: WHAT We Say & HOW We Say It

### Tone & Voice

**Core Characteristics:**
- **Decisive:** Clear opinions, clear direction (not exploratory)
- **Professional:** Serious engagement (not casual "let's chat")
- **Peer-Level:** Founder-to-founder (not vendor-to-client)
- **Technically Credible:** Show understanding (not jargon-heavy)
- **Speed-Oriented:** Fast is a feature (not a compromise)

**Voice Patterns to Embrace:**
- "Decide what to build" (not "explore possibilities")
- "Fast strategy" (not "discovery phase")
- "Validation before scale" (not "iterate and learn")
- "AI-first workflows" (not "AI integration services")
- "Evidence-driven" (not "data-informed")

**Voice Patterns to Avoid:**
- "Full-service agency"
- "End-to-end solutions"
- "Award-winning design"
- "Let's explore together"
- "Innovative approaches"
- "Passionate about"

---

### Messaging Hierarchy

**Primary Message (Hero):**
"Next Sketch helps founders decide what to build, why it matters, and who it's for—then build and validate it quickly using AI-first workflows."

**Supporting Messages:**

1. **Speed Without Sacrifice:**
   "Strategy is fast. Not exploratory. Not open-ended. Fast."

2. **Decisions Before Code:**
   "Know what to build before building it. Validate assumptions before scaling."

3. **Modern Methods:**
   "AI-first workflows for modern product challenges. Not legacy agency processes."

4. **Operational Extension:**
   "Same discipline applied inward. Reduce friction. Lower costs. Improve flow."

---

### Brand Voice Examples

**Good Examples (Use These Patterns):**
- "We help you decide what to build—fast."
- "Strategy that moves at product speed."
- "No discovery phase. No endless workshops. Just decisions and execution."
- "AI-first workflows for modern product teams."
- "Know what to build before building it."
- "Validation before scale. Evidence before iteration."

**Bad Examples (Avoid These Patterns):**
- "Let's explore your possibilities together"
- "Award-winning design and development"
- "We're passionate about innovation"
- "Full-service product agency"
- "End-to-end solutions for your business"
- "Let's chat about your needs"

**CTA Examples:**
- **Good:** "Start a Conversation" / "Talk to Us" / "Qualify Your Project"
- **Bad:** "Get Started" / "Free Consultation" / "Request a Quote" / "Learn More"

---

## 7. Conversation Qualifier: HOW We Convert

### Purpose (WHY It Matters)

**Not Lead Generation:**
- We're not trying to maximize form fills
- We're trying to maximize qualified conversations
- Better to have 5 perfect leads than 50 wrong ones

**Qualification Over Volume:**
- Right buyers should feel "this is exactly what I need"
- Wrong buyers should self-exclude before wasting anyone's time
- Implicit filtering through positioning, explicit filtering through qualifier

**Conversation Initiation:**
- Start strategic dialogue, not sales pitch
- First call should be about fit, not pitch
- Both parties assessing alignment

---

### Qualifier Strategy (WHAT It Does)

**Pre-Qualifier (Implicit):**
Site positioning filters buyers before they reach CTA:
- Serious tone → excludes casual explorers
- Speed emphasis → excludes slow-moving committees
- Retainer implications → excludes budget shoppers
- Decisiveness → excludes vague idea stage

**Active Qualifier (Explicit):**
Form/page that asks qualifying questions:
1. What stage is your product/company?
2. What's your primary goal? (Product / Operations / Both)
3. What's your timeline expectation?
4. Do you have budget allocated for retainer engagement?
5. Describe your challenge in one sentence.

**Post-Qualifier Actions:**
- **Qualified → Direct to calendar/email**
- **Not Qualified → Polite redirect or waitlist**
- **Unclear → Request for more context before proceeding**

---

### What We DON'T Do

**Explicitly Excluded from Phase 1:**
- ❌ Newsletter signup
- ❌ Free audit/consultation
- ❌ "Download our guide" lead magnet
- ❌ Generic "contact us" form
- ❌ Chat widget
- ❌ "Schedule a call" without qualification

**Why These Are Excluded:**
- They attract wrong buyers (curious, not committed)
- They create noise (volume over quality)
- They signal "agency" positioning (not partner)
- They waste time (ours and theirs)

---

## 8. Technical Philosophy: HOW We Build

### Stack Principles

**Framework Choice:**
- React / Next.js (developer discretion for specifics)
- Modern, maintainable, expandable
- No over-engineering for Phase 1

**Styling Approach:**
- Tailwind CSS recommended (rapid iteration)
- Design tokens for future brand evolution
- No hardcoded colors/spacing
- Mobile-first by default

**Content Management:**
- Lightweight CMS for copy updates only
- No heavy content modeling (Phase 1)
- Easy for non-technical team members
- Version control friendly

**Performance Requirements:**
- Sub-2 second initial load
- Optimized images (lazy loading)
- Minimal JavaScript where possible
- Smooth animations (transform/opacity only)

---

### Code Quality Standards

**Component Standards:**
- Atomic design (no file > 200 lines)
- TypeScript strict mode (all components)
- Explicit prop interfaces
- Accessibility built-in (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Animation Standards:**
- IntersectionObserver for scroll triggers
- Framer Motion or similar for interactions
- Performance over flashiness
- Graceful degradation (reduced-motion)

**Maintainability:**
- Clear file structure (see Architecture doc)
- Reusable UI components
- Design tokens in Tailwind config
- Comments explain "why" not "what"

---

## 9. Success Criteria: WHAT Success Looks Like

### Phase 1 Definition of Success

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Positioning Clarity (10-Second Test)**
   - Visitor understands what Next Sketch does immediately
   - Primary and secondary offerings are clearly distinct
   - Speed as differentiator comes through instantly

2. **Buyer Self-Qualification**
   - Target buyers think "this is exactly what I need"
   - Non-target buyers think "this isn't for me" (good outcome)
   - Conversation qualifier filters before time is wasted

3. **Professional Credibility**
   - Feels serious, not startup-y
   - Founder-to-founder peer relationship
   - Retainer model is implied correctly

4. **Technical Execution**
   - Xtract-level polish achieved
   - Smooth interactions and animations
   - Fast load times maintained
   - Mobile experience is excellent

---

### What Success Does NOT Require

**Explicitly Not Goals for Phase 1:**
- ❌ High traffic volume (quality over quantity)
- ❌ SEO dominance (direct/referral focus)
- ❌ Social proof displays (no testimonials by design)
- ❌ Viral content (not playing that game)
- ❌ Lead volume metrics (qualification metrics instead)

---

### Key Performance Indicators

**Qualitative Metrics (Primary):**
1. **Qualifier Completion Rate:** Are people finishing the qualifier?
2. **Qualified vs Unqualified Ratio:** Attracting right buyers?
3. **First Call Quality:** Do prospects understand offering correctly?
4. **Time to Clarity:** How fast do prospects "get it"?

**Quantitative Metrics (Secondary):**
1. **Page Load Speed:** < 2 seconds
2. **Mobile Traffic %:** Should be 40%+
3. **Scroll Depth:** Are people seeing full story?
4. **CTA Click Rate:** Are CTAs compelling enough?

**Wrong Metrics to Ignore:**
- Total traffic (quality > volume)
- Form fills (qualifier completion > lead volume)
- Time on page (clarity > engagement)
- Page views (focus > exploration)

---
