    question: 'How is this different from a traditional agency?',
    answer:
      "We're not an agency. Agencies sell services by the hour and optimize for billable time. We're a strategic partner focused on outcomes — making product decisions faster, validating them with evidence, and shipping with AI-first workflows. No drawn-out discovery phases. No exploratory workshops. Just decisions and execution.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What does "fast strategy" actually mean?',
    answer:
      'It means strategy that produces decisions in days, not months. We compress traditional discovery into focused, constraint-driven sessions that define exactly what to build, why it matters, and who it\'s for. Then we execute immediately. Speed is a feature of our process, not a compromise.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you work with early-stage startups?',
    answer:
      "We work with product-stage companies — typically seed to Series A. You need a product vision (even if unclear), a real timeline, and budget for a retainer engagement. If you're at the 'we have a vague idea' stage, we're probably not the right fit yet.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What does a typical engagement look like?',
    answer:
      'Engagements are retainer-based, not project-based. This lets us move fast without scoping overhead and stay embedded as your product evolves. We typically start with rapid strategy to define constraints and a build plan, then move into continuous execution and validation cycles.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does "AI-first" mean in practice?',
    answer:
      'It means AI is embedded in how we work and what we build — from the start. We use AI to accelerate research, prototyping, development, and decision-making. For your product, it means we build with modern AI capabilities in mind rather than retrofitting them later.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you price engagements?',
    answer:
      "We work on monthly retainer engagements. This model supports the speed and continuity that makes our approach work. Specific numbers depend on scope and complexity — we'll discuss this during our conversation to make sure there's alignment before either of us commits time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if we're the right fit?",
    answer:
      "You're likely a good fit if you have a product vision that needs clarity, urgency to move fast, and budget for a serious engagement. You're probably not a fit if you're looking for a cheap option, want to 'explore possibilities,' or need months of stakeholder alignment before making decisions. Our qualifier helps both of us figure this out quickly.",
